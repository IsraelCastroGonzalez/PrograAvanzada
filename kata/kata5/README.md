# Infografic

### You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

## To do this, you'll need data. 
 
 - Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a hash table â†´ , where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.
- Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:

    * "After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:"

    * "Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar."

What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your final hash table should include one "Add" or "add" with a value of  2

- Ok so how do we start, this seems somewhat complicated but it might be easier than it looks
- Teacher gave us a little push in class but still have trouble understanding what it does
- TALLER VERTICAL!!!
- OK, I have NO idea what i have to do since its been a week and its like my brain just rebooted.

**1** Bild a Hash Table
   
**2** Count the words and save the values(try to do the thing that the problem advices to do).

**3** Check which ones have the biggest values and print them with a big font size or different color(???how)
