# WHAT IS THIS ABOUT

**The whole background is as it follows:**

The public transport administration of Ekaterinburg is anxious about the fact that passengers don’t like to pay for passage doing their best to avoid the fee. All the measures that had been taken (hard currency premiums for all of the chiefs, increase in conductors’ salaries, reduction of number of buses) were in vain. An advisor especially invited from the Ural State University says that personally he doesn’t buy tickets because he rarely comes across the lucky ones (a ticket is lucky if the sum of the first three digits in its number equals to the sum of the last three ones). So, the way out is found — of course, tickets must be numbered in sequence, but the number of digits on a ticket may be changed. Say, if there were only two digits, there would have been ten lucky tickets (with numbers 00, 11, …, 99). Maybe under the circumstances the ratio of the lucky tickets to the common ones is greater? And what if we take four digits? A huge work has brought the long-awaited result: in this case there will be 670 lucky tickets. But what to do if there are six or more digits?

**But only this part seemed the most important:**
_A ticket is lucky if the sum of the first three digits in its number equals to the sum of the last three ones_

This means that for a two digit number there would be 10 possible lucky tickets e.g. (00,11,22,...,99). Because if you draw a line in the middle (1|1) and then add every number on the left side and every number on the right side they are going tho have the same number; in this case 1 and 1.

_There can not be more than 9 digits_
